# 0-inbox

**Purpose**: Temporary holding area for unprocessed notes and captured information.

## Overview

This folder serves as the GTD-style inbox for your notes system. All new notes, quick captures, web clips, and incoming information should land here first before being processed and moved to their permanent location.

## Workflow

1. **Capture**: New notes go here (from Telegram, browser, quick thoughts)
2. **Process**: During daily/weekly triage, classify each note
3. **Move**: Route to appropriate permanent location:
   - Living documents → `1-active/[focus-area]/`
   - Permanent knowledge → `2-knowledge/zettel/` or `literature/`
   - Reference material → `2-knowledge/reference/`
   - Historical content → `3-archive/`

## Keep It Empty

This folder should be processed regularly and kept as close to empty as possible. Aim for:
- **Daily**: Process simple items (<5 minutes)
- **Weekly**: Clear all remaining items during weekly review

## Processing Guidelines

**Ask yourself**:
- Is this actionable? → Create task in org-mode, file note in appropriate focus area
- Is this reference? → Move to `2-knowledge/`
- Is this project-specific? → Move to `1-active/[focus-area]/`
- Is this permanent knowledge? → Move to `2-knowledge/zettel/`
- Is this source material? → Move to `2-knowledge/literature/`
- Can I delete this? → Delete or move to `3-archive/deprecated/`
