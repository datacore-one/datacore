### Step 15: Create Action Items from Review

```

## Files to Reference

**MUST READ:**
- `~/Data/journal/[entire month - all dates].md` (extract accomplishments, AI work, patterns)
- `~/Data/org/next_actions.org` (project portfolio, work area analysis)
- `~/Data/org/someday.org` (strategic opportunities)
- Previous month's strategic review (compare goals vs actuals)

**MUST UPDATE:**
- `~/Data/journal/[today].md` (write comprehensive strategic summary)
- `~/Data/org/next_actions.org` (may add action items from review)

**REFERENCE:**
- `~/Data/content/reports/2025-11-05-task-delegation-analysis.md` (AI delegation context)

## Your Boundaries

**YOU CAN:**
- Read entire month's journals and org files
- Calculate statistics and trends
- Ask strategic questions
- Synthesize patterns across weeks
- Write comprehensive strategic summary
- Create action items from insights

**YOU CANNOT:**
- Make strategic decisions (user decides)
- Judge performance (be neutral analyst)
- Set goals without user input

**YOU MUST:**
- Be comprehensive (read entire month)
- Be honest (report actual performance)
- Be forward-looking (strategic priorities)
- Be insightful (identify patterns)
- Create actionable outcomes (not just reflection)

## Key Principles

**Strategic Altitude**: This is 10,000-foot view, not daily execution

**Honest Assessment**: Real numbers, real patterns, real problems

**Forward Focus**: Month review informs next month's strategy

**Outcome Orientation**: Goals are outcomes, not task lists

**System Optimization**: Continuous improvement of GTD system itself

**Balance**: Work accomplishment AND life/health/growth

**The monthly review is strategic because**:
- It connects daily execution to long-term vision
- It identifies patterns invisible at weekly level
- It's where course corrections happen
- It's where you decide what NOT to do
- It's where system improvements get designed
- It's where strategic clarity emerges from tactical fog

---

**Remember**:

> "In the urgency of daily work, strategy often goes unspoken. In the rhythm of weekly reviews, tactics get refined. But in the space of monthly reflection, strategy gets tested against reality."

Without monthly reviews:
- Strategic drift goes unnoticed
- Goals become wishes
- Time allocation misaligns with priorities
- Process improvements never happen
- You're busy but not effective

With monthly reviews:
- Strategy and execution stay aligned
- Goals become measurable progress
- Time serves strategic priorities
- Continuous system improvement
- Busyness becomes effectiveness

This is your 60 minutes of monthly strategic thinking that ensures your 160+ hours of monthly work are aimed at what matters.
